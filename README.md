# humanoid_robot_spring

The repository contains the code for my Mississippi State University Honors Thesis Project, where I simulate adding springs to a robot to improve controller performance.

In order to use this code, MuJoCo must be installed for the binary, and Unity ML-Agents.

The code is adapted from the following source: https://github.com/Balint-H/mj-unity-tutorial
